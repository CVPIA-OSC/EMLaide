\section{Measurement Scales}{

\itemize{
\item \strong{nominal}: Used to define categorical scale attributes.
Nominal is used when numbers have only been assigned to a variable for the
purpose of categorizing the variable. An example of a nominal scale is
assigning the number 1 for male and 2 for female.
\item \strong{ordinal}: Used to define ordered scale attributes. Ordinal is
used when the categories have a logical or ordered relationship to each other.
These types of scale allow one to distinguish the order of values, but not
the magnitude of the difference between values. An example of an ordinal
scale is a categorical survey where you rank a variable 1=good, 2=fair, 3=poor.
\item \strong{interval}: Used to define interval scale attributes. Intervals
define data which consist of equidistant points on a scale. For example
temperature data, mark grading, IQ scale, etc. Intervals can be negative
while ratios cannot
\item \strong{ratio}: Used to define ratio scale attributes. Ratios define
data which consists not only of equidistant points but also has a meaningful zero
point, which allows the ratio to have meaning. For example measurement heights,
flow rates, weight, length, etc.
\item \strong{dateTime}: Used to define date and time attributes. DateTime
is used when the values fall on the Gregorian calendar system.  DateTime values
are special because they have properties of interval values (most of the
time it is legitimate to treat them as interval values by converting them
to a duration from a fixed point) but they sometimes only behave as ordinals
(because the calendar is not predetermined, for some dateTime values one can
only find out the order of the points and not the magnitude of the duration
between those points). The most encompassing format is: YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.
