Description: This package was created in support of the data guidance to increase, 
    manage, and protect the value of data needed and generated by the CVPIA Science 
    Integration Team, specifically through the Structured Decision Making (SDM) process. In order to implement SDM, 
    the agencies needed to assess all of the data available to build decision models and improve 
    the basis and defensibility of decisions. According to data management best practices, 
    metadata is key to insuring the data is discoverable and available for reuse. 
    This package contains functions to enable SIT participants to develop metadata 
    documents that are in valid EML syntax and compatible with EDIâ€™s data repository, 
    the data repository used by CVPIA member agencies.
